# neepuEYE dataset
## Brief description
This is an image dataset named neepuEye dataset which contains some low-resolution near-infrared images that were captured under laboratory conditions. 
This dataset was splitted into two subsets: training subset and test subset. 

The training subset contains around 5500 images of 109 subjects.The training images are suitable for generating  samples that can be used to train an eye detector.

The test subset contains around 1300 images and 2300 eyes which are augmented data from 224 original images of 11 subjects. The test images can be used to validate an eye detector or a pupil localizer.
